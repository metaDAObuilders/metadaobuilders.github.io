To whom it may concern,

Hello, we are the builders of the Meta-DAO. Please allow us 5 minutes to explain what the Meta-DAO is, and how you might benefit from joining it.

We shall structure our monologue like so:
- Purpose
- Mechanics
- Why you should join

## Purpose

Have you ever worked at a big company? If you have, you know how soul-crushing they can be. 

Still, big companies survive. Because of economies of scale and scope, big companies are usually more economically efficient than their smaller counterparts. 

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is not immune from these incentives. At its inception, most people believed that DeFi would exist as an interconnected ecosystem of micro-products ('financial legos'). As time has progressed, more and more people in the weeds of DeFi are waking up to the fact that this may not make sense.[^1]

This is the purpose of the Meta-DAO. To build a DeFi organization that can scale without adopting the soul-crushing measures of big companies.

## Mechanics

All organizations that manage humans and capital at scale encounter one key problem. This is: 'how do you ensure that the various humans in the organization are taking actions that benefit the group?' For those interested, this problem is described more in detail here: TODO.

The Meta-DAO's approach to this problem mirrors that of existing DAOs, with three key differences. As in existing DAOs, actions are proposed and enacted through *improvement proposals*. The differences are the following:
- the Meta-DAO is not a monolithic DAO but is instead comprised of numerous 'members', analogous to divisions at a company
- for each improvement proposal, the Meta-DAO uses a market-based mechanism to estimate that proposal's impact on each member
- to decide whether a proposal should pass or fail, the Meta-DAO does the following:
  - computes, from these individual impacts, whether a proposal would be net-positive or net-negative for the members
  - passes and executes proposals that are estimated to be net-positive
  - fails and disregards proposals that are estimated to be net-negative

More on mechanics can be found here: TODO.

## Why you should join

Let us suppose that you are thinking "sure, this would be great once it gets scale, but I wouldn't join until then." In other words, you have decided that "wait and see" is the optimal algorithm in this situation.

To quell this concern, we have adopted a common approach to this problem: network mining. A token called $META shall exist which will give its holders a claim upon 50% of all members' tokens. Each block, an equal amount of $META is to be distributed to each member, for each member to divvy up how they see fit. Importantly, $META will follow the reward distribution of Bitcoin, such that there are only 21 million $META ever mined and early miners will receive far more $META than late miners. 

In other words, you have a strong financial incentive to join earlier rather than later. 

[^1]: Examples of DeFi DAOs that exploit economies of scale and/or scope include MakerDAO (many contributors focused on DAI optimization), Sushi (multiple products), Uniswap (multiple products), Fei/Rari before disbanding (multiple products), Gnosis (multiple products, although some have been spun out), Yearn (many contributors), and Curve (once it releases its stablecoin). Two main reasons for this consolidation are **product-optimization economies of scale** (simply, that bigger DAOs can affort to optimize more, which in turn makes them bigger) and **brand and community-driven economies of scope** (it is easier to launch a product under an existing brand than to develop a new brand and community). Note that as DeFi expands to mass market, both of these incentives are likely to get stronger because (1) a larger market allows for more optimization and (2) a mass-market customer is unlikely to be searching for new products, and will instead tend to stick with the products and brands they know.
